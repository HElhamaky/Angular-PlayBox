# App Essentials
#### This chapter covers the essentials of Angular applications so that you can understand how everything fits together. It will be a good reference for the fundamentals. It is focused on concepts, and there are no coding projects. You may be eager to jump into coding, and I certainly understand that. I recommend you take the time to read this chapter in its entirety, but you can also start by skimming the first couple paragraphs of each section. While in college, I studied abroad in Germany and was fortunate enough to do some traveling. I took a number of tours, but two I remember well were a tour of some salt mines in southern Germany and a tour of the Uffizi Museum in Florence, Italy. I learned a lot of interesting facts about salt mines, but I had no real background in mining. On the other hand, I had been taking an art history class, which made the experience of the Uffizi Museum far more satisfying.
